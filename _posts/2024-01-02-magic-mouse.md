The first year of the Master's in Game Programming at Rubika includes an intensive two-week period where we have to create a Twin Stick Shooter in 2 weeks.

This project is a collaboration between Game Artists, Designers, and Programmers.

In this cooperative puzzle game, two players each control a magical mouse. Each mouse has an assigned color, one is red, and the other is blue. When players pass a magic sphere to each other, it takes the color of the player receiving the sphere, changes its behavior, and grants powers to its possessor...

For this project, I took on the role of Unity gameplay and tool developer. I primarily focused on the physics of the ball, player actions, and a tool to generate paths along a spline.

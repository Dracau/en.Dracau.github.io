A one-week freelance mission for an investment consulting company.


I was tasked with creating a 2D runner set in an ecological theme. Points earned by players were converted into donations for environmental protection associations.

I also developed a tool for the company to retrieve the list of players and their scores.

This mission lasted a week, during which I handled the entire game design and programming for this game on **Unity**, based on the specifications provided by the company.

The first year of the Master's in Game Programming at Rubika includes a project for Steam, spanning from November 2022 to January 2023.

This project is a collaboration between the Game Programming and Game Design tracks, with teams of 6 students.

In this game, players control a bear trying to sleep but is disturbed by the noisy party next door. The objective is to interrupt the party by eliminating as many people as possible using objects found in the house.

For this project, I took on the role of gameplay and tool developer. I focused primarily on the modularity of the player controller, the object system, and the smooth integration of objects through the tools.
